PA2 README

For this PA, I implemented the Bison parser in accodance to the GLSL specifications that were highlighted in chapter 10 of the handbook. At first, I attempted to fix the grammar in a way so that we didn't as many rules as the highlighted portion of the handbook but inevidently it ran into a lot of errors. So then, I just followed the highlighted specifications with a few rules dissolved for better readability.

Also, I added the T_Vec2 T_Vec3 T_Vec4 type implementations as well and used the AST files in order to provide the correct actions for each rule.

Lastly, error recovery was not attempted due to it being removed from the requirements and a lack of time.
